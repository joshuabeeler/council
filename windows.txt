On Windows you will need to do two things before being able to run `heroku local`:

Run `go build -o bin/go-getting-started.exe -v` instead of the command listed above.

Alter Procfile so it’s contents are: `web: bin\go-getting-started.exe` instead of what is in the checkout.
Don’t commit changes to Procfile though, otherwise your application’s web process won’t be able to start on Heroku.
