## Council Circle Assitant Template

[Council Circle Assistant Template in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfnQF0CdS6SiegmbfevmZ6r_XNXZXmInH89JAcCtHCs/edit?usp=sharing)

Great for visualizing who is sitting where in an online council.

Instructions for using the assistant in a Zoom council:
1. You'll need an additional device (ideally, a computer) connected to the Zoom meeting to run the assistant. I'll refer to this the assistant device.
2. Make a copy of the assistant template for your own use. Open the template in Google Sheets and select File > Make a copy.
3. On the assistant device, open your assistant in a web browser, click on the second tab ("Circle") in the assistant, and make the browser window full screen.
4. Have the assistant device join the council Zoom meeting.
5. Once in the Zoom meeting, have the assistant device share its screen.
6. This will make the circle assistant visible to all meeting participants.
7. On the computer you're using as the meeting host, open the circle assistant in your browser and add participants to the first tab ("Participants") in whatever order you like. This will populate the circle on the second tab, and everyone will be able to see the circle through the assistant device's shared screen.

## Meetup Text

This group is for anyone who is interested in experiencing council.

Council is a practice in which people gather in a circle, pass around a talking piece, and take turns sharing stories in response to prompts. This drop-in circle meets monthly at a private residence in Mount Washington and features a different topic each month. All are welcome.

Here's a more detailed description of council from centerforcouncil.org:

"Council is an age-old practice that involves bringing people together in a circle to bear witness and share authentically. Participants agree to speak one-at-a-time, sharing their personal stories and experiences, rather than opinions, and listening non-judgmentally while others do the same. Sharing and listening to universal stories about love, loss, fear, triumph, challenge, hope and other experiences enables participants to recognize that, despite our many differences, we have much in common."
