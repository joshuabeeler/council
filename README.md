## Council Circle Assitant Template

[Council Circle Assistant Template in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfnQF0CdS6SiegmbfevmZ6r_XNXZXmInH89JAcCtHCs/edit?usp=sharing)

Great for visualizing who is sitting where in an online council.

Instructions for using the assistant in a Zoom council:
1. You'll need an additional device (ideally, a computer) connected to the Zoom meeting to run the assistant. I'll refer to this the assistant device.
2. Make a copy of the assistant template for your own use. Open the template in Google Sheets and select File > Make a copy.
3. On the assistant device, open your assistant in a web browser, click on the second tab ("Circle") in the assistant, and make the browser window full screen.
4. Have the assistant device join the council Zoom meeting.
5. Once in the Zoom meeting, have the assistant device share its screen.
6. This will make the circle assistant visible to all meeting participants.
7. On the computer you're using as the meeting host, open the circle assistant in your browser and add participants to the first tab ("Participants") in whatever order you like. This will populate the circle on the second tab, and everyone will be able to see the circle through the assistant device's shared screen.
